# HederaGuard AI Agent - Hackathon Presentation

## Introduction

HederaGuard AI Agent is an AI-powered smart contract security platform built on Hedera. Our mission is to make blockchain development safer through accessible, intelligent contract auditing.

## The Problem

1. Smart contract vulnerabilities cost billions annually in hacks and exploits
2. Manual audits are expensive and time-consuming
3. Developers need tools to identify issues early in development
4. Hedera ecosystem needs specialized security tooling

## Our Solution

HederaGuard leverages AI to provide:

1. **Automated vulnerability detection** using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model
2. **Real-time gas optimization** suggestions to reduce costs
3. **Best practices guidance** for Hedera smart contract development
4. **Wallet integration** for real blockchain interactions

## Technical Architecture

1. **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with shadcn components
2. **Backend**: Node.js + Express
3. **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 2.0 Flash integration
4. **Blockchain**: Direct Hedera Testnet integration

## Key Integrations

1. **Hedera Account ID**: 0.0.5798618
2. **Hedera HashScan**: [View Account](https://hashscan.io/testnet/account/0.0.5798618?ps=1&pr=1&pa=1&pf=1&ph=1&pt=1&pc=1&pn=1&p2=1&p3=1&p1=1&k1=1743431620.578161000)
3. **Wallet Connection**: MetaMask with Atomic Wallet UI representation
4. **AI Integration**: Gemini 2.0 Flash model for sophisticated analysis

## Demo

Live demonstration of:

1. **Contract Submission**: Paste your Solidity code
2. **AI Analysis**: Automatic vulnerability detection
3. **Results Review**: Explore findings by severity
4. **PDF Export**: Save and share professional reports
5. **Social Sharing**: Twitter integration for sharing results

## Future Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Analysis**: More advanced vulnerability detection
2. **Multiple Contract Support**: Full project scanning
3. **Custom Rules Engine**: Create organization-specific security rules
4. **Mainnet Integration**: Production-ready deployment
